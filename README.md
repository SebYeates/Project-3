### App overview
The Hidden Gems website is a place where the user can look for "Hidden Gems" based on looking up a location or find "trips" that link different "Hidden Gems" into a tour. The user can also add their own "Gems" or create "Trips" using any "Hidden Gems". Other features of the App are being able to follow other users. Navigate to a Gem from your location to the gem selected location via using a third party Navigation system such as google maps.
